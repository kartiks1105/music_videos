I was watching some music videos of songs I used to listen in middle school and thought instead of having to open YouTube and search for a video everytime, might as well create a little file that has all my music data.

So I wrote a Python script that reads a file which contains all the music in my library and stores the data in a dataframe. Then, using the youtubesearchpython library, I search for the song name on Youtube and get the link for the music video. I created a new column in the dataframe which has the links to the official music videos.
